lollipop is a general purpose, functional programming language with support for linear types. This is a bachelor thesis project at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg. 

### Goal
The main goal is to develop a proof-of-concept of linear types in a basic functional language. This is to enable easy access to the concept for developers that are interested in learning about linear types, in a practical environment.
